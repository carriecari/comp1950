                    <p>Tomas Polomsky has completed his COMP 1850 course at BCIT during a semester and that's as far as his knowledge in web-development reaches. He is also taking an web graphics course this semester and plans on learning more about the universe that is web-development.
                     I was born in Vancouver but my background comes from the Czech Republic. I can speak in a "broken" form of the czech/slovak language and enjoy visiting there.</p>

                    Carrie Lam took on learning html when she got her first computer to make websites dedicated to her favourite anime characters. Most of the skills she possesses are self-taught such as learning all the Adobe Creative Suite applications, video editing software and some front-end web frameworks. Her formal education includes learning C++ and Visual Basic in first year computer science courses at SFU. She recently started taking web development courses at BCIT on top of her full-time position as a research associate.
